# AES Cipher Implementation (C#)

This project is a very basic implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in C#. It was designed as a personal exercise to understand AES and other Feistel cipher-like encryption techniques. The project provides an in-depth exploration of symmetric encryption, focusing on AESâ€™s internals, encryption rounds, and key expansion process. It has, by no means, been developed with upmost security in mind.

## Overview

AES is one of the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithms. It operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits) and supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. This project allows you to explore how AES works by implementing it in C#, with a focus on understanding the various steps involved, including:
- **Key expansion**: Generation of round keys from the initial cipher key.
- **SubBytes**: A non-linear substitution step.
- **ShiftRows**: A transposition step.
- **MixColumns**: A mixing transformation for diffusion.
- **AddRoundKey**: Combining the data with round keys.

This implementation aims to highlight the mathematical foundation of AES and its similarity to Feistel cipher structures, making it a great learning tool for anyone wanting to dive deep into encryption algorithms.

## Features

- AES encryption and decryption with key sizes of 128 bits.
- Manual key expansion process.
- Support for both encryption and decryption rounds.
- Clear separation between key stages and transformation steps.
- Implementation of the core AES transformations: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.
